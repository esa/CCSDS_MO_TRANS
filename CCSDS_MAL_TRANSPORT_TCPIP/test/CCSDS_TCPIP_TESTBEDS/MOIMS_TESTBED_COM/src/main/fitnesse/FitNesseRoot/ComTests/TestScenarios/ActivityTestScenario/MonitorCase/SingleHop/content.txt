!4 Monitoring a Single hop activity test procedure
This tests that activities can be monitored in a single hop situation, specifically:
* That relays return the correct messages
* That the returned messages have the correct header fields
* That the returned messages have the correct body fields
* That the originating pattern is failed by the relays if appropriate
