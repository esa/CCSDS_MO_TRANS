!2 Activity test scenario
The COM Activity service test scenario is split into several test cases, each testing a specific aspect of the Activity service.
The cases are split according to the following:
* Test the use of the Activity service in a configuration in which the test service provider communicates directly with the client
* Test the use of the Activity service in a configuration in which the test service provider communicates with the client via a single relay
* Test the use of the Activity service in a configuration in which the test service provider communicates with the client via a number of relays

The test service provider is required to implement the !-ActivityTest-! service, and support all capability sets of the !-Activity-! service.
Each of the test cases details the required behaviour of the test service provider and also the test client.
