!3 Delete operation test case
This tests each prescriptive statement defined for the operation 'delete'.

!4 General update
Checks the following statements:
* a) The first part of the request shall contain the type of object to match and is not permitted to contain the wildcard value.
* b) The second part of the request shall contain the domain of the objects to match and is not permitted to contain the wildcard value.
* c) If either the first or second part contain a wildcard value then an INVALID error shall be returned and no object deleted.
* d) The third part of the request shall contain the list of object instance identifiers to match.
* g) The matched objects shall be deleted from the archive.
* h) The response shall contain the set of object instance identifiers of the deleted objects.
* INVALID) The supplied object type or domain contains a wildcard value.
