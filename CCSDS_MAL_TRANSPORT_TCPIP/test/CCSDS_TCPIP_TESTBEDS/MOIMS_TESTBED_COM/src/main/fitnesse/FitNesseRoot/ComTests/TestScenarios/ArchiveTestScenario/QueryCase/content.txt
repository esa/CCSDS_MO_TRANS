!3 Query operation test case
This tests each prescriptive statement defined for the operations 'query' and 'count' as they both follow the same rules for input parameters.

!4 General query
Checks the following statements:
* a) The first part of the request shall contain a Boolean that if set to TRUE requests that the body of the objects is returned otherwise only the !-ObjectType-! and !-ArchiveDetails-! shall be returned and the returned list of the bodies of the objects shall be replaced with a NULL.
* b) The second part of the request shall contain the type of object required.
* d) The third and fourth parts of the request shall contain the queries to evaluate.
* e) A single query shall be formed by the combination of an !-ArchiveQuery-! from the first list and a !-QueryFilter-! from the second list.
* f) The two lists shall be ordered identically so that the query and the filter parts can be matched together.
* j) For each query, the !-ArchiveQuery-! and the !-QueryFilter-! shall contain the COM object fields to filter on.
* q) The updates and the responses shall contain the set of matched objects.
* s) If there was not any wildcards in the !-ObjectType-! part of the request the !-ObjectType-! in the updates and response shall be replaced by a NULL.
* v) There shall be an entry in the second and third lists for each matched object.
* w) The second returned list shall contain the archive details stored for the matched objects.
* x) If the initial Boolean of the request was True the third returned list shall contain the bodies of the objects.
* y) If the initial Boolean of the request was NULL or False the third returned list shall be replaced by a NULL.
