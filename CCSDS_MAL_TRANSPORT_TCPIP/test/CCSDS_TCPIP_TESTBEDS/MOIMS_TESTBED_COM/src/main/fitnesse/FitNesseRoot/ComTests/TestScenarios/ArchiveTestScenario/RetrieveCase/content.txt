!3 Retrieve operation test case
This tests each prescriptive statement defined for the operation 'retrieve'.

!4 General retrieve
Checks the following statements:
* a) The first part of the request shall contain the type of object required.
* c) The second part of the request shall contain the domain to match.
* e) The third part of the request shall contain the list of object instance identifiers to match.
* h) The response shall contain the set of matched objects.
* i) The first returned list shall contain the matched object instance identifiers and object details of the matched objects.
* j) The second returned list shall contain the object bodies ordered identically to the first list unless no body for the object is declared in the service specification, in which case a NULL replaces the complete list.
* k) There shall be an entry in each returned list for each matched object.
* m) The ordering of the returned objects is not specified and implementation specific.
* n) If ordering of the returned objects is required then the query operation should be used instead.
