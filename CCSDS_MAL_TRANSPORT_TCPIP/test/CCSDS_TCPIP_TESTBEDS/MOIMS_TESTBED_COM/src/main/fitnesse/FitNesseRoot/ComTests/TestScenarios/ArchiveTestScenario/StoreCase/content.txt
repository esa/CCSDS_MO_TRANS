!3 Store operation test case
This tests each prescriptive statement defined for the operation 'store'.

!4 General store
Checks the following statements:
* a) The first part of the request indicates whether the operation should return the object instance identifiers used, if TRUE it shall return them, otherwise it returns NULL.
* b) The second part of the request shall contain the type of object being stored.
* c) The third part of the request shall contain the domain of the objects being stored.
* d) The fourth part of the request shall contain the list of archive details to use, one for each object being stored.
* g) The fifth part of the request shall contain the list of objects to store.
* o) The response shall contain the set of new object instance identifiers if the request supplied an initial TRUE Boolean value, otherwise it returns NULL.
* p) The returned list shall be ordered identically to the submitted list so that the returned object instance identifiers can be mapped to the correct objects.

!4 Object type checking
* m) The type of the body of the object should be checked against the declared type in the relevant service specification, if different an INVALID error is raised.

Should statements are not tested.

!4 Size
h)	The fourth and fifth list must be the same size as there is only entry in each for each object to be stored. If they differ in size and INVALID error is returned with the extra error information integer giving the index of the list entry without a matching entry in the other list.
