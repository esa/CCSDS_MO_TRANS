!3 Update operation test case
This tests each prescriptive statement defined for the operation 'update'.

!4 General update
Checks the following statements:
* a) The first part of the request shall contain the type of object being updated.
* b) The second part of the request shall contain the domain of the objects being updated.
* c) The third part of the request shall contain the list of !-ArchiveDetails-!.
* d) The object instance identifier contained in the !-ArchiveDetails-!, combined with the object type and domain from the request, shall be used to match objects.
* f) The remainder of the !-ArchiveDetails-! shall be used to update the matched objects.
* g) The fourth part of the request shall contain the list of objects to replace the matched objects with.

* UNKNOWN.a) One or more of the requested objects specified in the operation do not exist and therefore cannot be found.
* UNKNOWN.b) The indexes of the error values shall be contained in the extra information field.
