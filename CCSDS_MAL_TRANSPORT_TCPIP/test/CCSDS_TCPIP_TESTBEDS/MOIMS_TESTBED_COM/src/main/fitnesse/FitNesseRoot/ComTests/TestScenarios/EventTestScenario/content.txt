!2 Event test scenario
The COM Event service test scenario consists of a single test case, which tests all aspects of the Event service.
It tests the prescriptive statements defined about occurrences by the Event 
The test covers the following
* The event service may be used for the publishing and monitoring of COM events.
* The identification of the event shall follow the COM object rules
* The event has an associated body which is published with the payload
* The MAL::!-EntityKey-! is correctly populated
* An event in one domain may be generated by something in another domain 
The test also covers the following items related to archive service usage
* Each type of an event is a separate COM object type
* The related link is service specific and shall be null if not explicitly used
* The source link shall point to the source of the object 
* The body of the event shall be the event payload
* All events are archived

The events generated include a number of fields that use a range of types covering
the MAL types: String, Numerics, Lists, ENUM and composite 


The test service provider is required to implement the !-EventTest-! service, and support all capability sets of the !-Event-! service.
Each of the test cases details the required behaviour of the test service provider and also the test client.
