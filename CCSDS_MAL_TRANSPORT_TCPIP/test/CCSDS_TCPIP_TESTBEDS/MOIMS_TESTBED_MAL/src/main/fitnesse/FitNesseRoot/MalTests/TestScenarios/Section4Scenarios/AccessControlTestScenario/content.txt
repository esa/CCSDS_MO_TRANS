!2 Access control test scenario
The Access Control interface has to be implemented by a test security module in charge of checking that the primitive CHECK is called by the MAL. The message passed with the CHECK request is returned to the MAL without being modified through the CHECK Response indication.
The consumer process has to create a MAL instance that uses the test security module.

!4 Test procedure: CHECK interaction

*******!
The consumer has to do the following actions:
 1 create an IPTest consumer
 2 for each type of interaction
 3 initiate an interaction by calling the relevant operation
 4 wait for the end of the interaction
 5 check that the MAL has interacted the correct number of times with Access Control.
 6 check that each message that passed through Access Control has the correct interaction type and stage

Another check is also performed that ensures that if a message is modified by Access Control, that the modified
message is used from that point onwards. The test AC component reverses the bytes of the authentication id.
