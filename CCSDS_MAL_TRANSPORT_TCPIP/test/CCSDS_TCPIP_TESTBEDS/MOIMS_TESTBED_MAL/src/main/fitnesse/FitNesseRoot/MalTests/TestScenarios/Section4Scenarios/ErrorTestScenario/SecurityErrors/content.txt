!3 Test Case: Security errors
The test security module raises specific errors depending on the operation called:

|Comment|
|Service|	Operation|	Error to raise|
|!-ErrorTest-!|	!-testAuthenticationFailure-! |	AUTHENTICATION_FAIL|
|!-ErrorTest-!|	!-testAuthorisationFailure-! |	AUTHORISATION_FAIL|

This test checks that they are rejected locally first and then remotely.

!4 Test procedure: authentication failure
The !-ErrorTest-! consumer calls the operation !-testAuthenticationFail-! and checks that the error AUTHENTICATION_FAIL is returned.

|script| Access control error scenario|
|ensure| security manager has been created|
|switch on local rejections|
|ensure|a !-testAuthenticationFailure-! interaction fails|
|ensure|error type is |AUTHENTICATION_FAIL|
|ensure|error source is |local|
|switch off local rejections|
|ensure|a !-testAuthenticationFailure-! interaction fails|
|ensure|error type is |AUTHENTICATION_FAIL|
|ensure|error source is |remote|

!4 Test procedure: authorization failure
The !-ErrorTest-! consumer calls the operation !-testAuthorisationFail-! and checks that the error AUTHORISATION_FAIL is returned.
