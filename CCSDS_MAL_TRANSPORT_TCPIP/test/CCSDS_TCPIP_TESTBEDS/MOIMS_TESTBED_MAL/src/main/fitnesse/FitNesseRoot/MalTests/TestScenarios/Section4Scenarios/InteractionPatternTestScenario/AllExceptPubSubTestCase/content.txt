!3 Test case: all patterns except Pub/Sub
The consumer initiates the patterns by calling the following operations provided by the service IPTest:
 * send
 * submit
 * request
 * invoke
 * progress
Those operations shall be called once for each !-QoS-! level and session type. It is not necessary to test each combination of !-QoS-! and session. One call for each !-QoS-! level and session type is enough.

The following parameters are used to make the calls:
|comment|
|authenticationId|	{0x00, 0x01}|
|qos|	Best Effort, Assured, Queued, Timely|
|priority|	1|
|domain|	{"Test", "Domain"}|
|networkZone|	"!-TestNetwork-!"|
|session|	Live, Simulation, Replay|
|session name|!{Live:"LIVE", Replay:"R1", Simulation:"S1"}|

The consumer has to execute the following test procedure for every possible header values (!-QoS-! and session fields) and every possible transitions. The name of the procedure is built from the parameters:
 * ip: name of the tested IP
 * qos: !-QoS-! level to be used
 * session: session type to be used
 * transition list id: identifier of the IPTestTransitionList that is expected by the consumer (see table above).
