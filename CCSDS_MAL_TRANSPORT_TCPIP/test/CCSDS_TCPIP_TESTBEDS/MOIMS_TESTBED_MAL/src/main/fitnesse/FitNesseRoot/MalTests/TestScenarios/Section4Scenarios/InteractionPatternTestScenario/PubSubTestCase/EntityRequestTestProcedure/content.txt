!4 Test procedure: entity request
This test checks that the entity requests are correctly interpreted by the broker, in particular the expression used to define the expected entities.
A list of entity keys is defined:
 * A
 * A.2
 * A.2.3
 * A.2.3.4
 * B
 * Q.2.3
A list of entity request expressions is defined:
 * A
 * A.[null]
 * A.*
 * A.2.[null]
 * A.2.*
 * [null].B.[null]
 * *.2.*
 * *
The consumer does the following actions:
 * Creation of one subscription for each expression and registration.
 * Trigger the publication of one !-TestUpdate-! for each entity key.
 
The consumer checks that the expected keys are received and only them (see table below).
