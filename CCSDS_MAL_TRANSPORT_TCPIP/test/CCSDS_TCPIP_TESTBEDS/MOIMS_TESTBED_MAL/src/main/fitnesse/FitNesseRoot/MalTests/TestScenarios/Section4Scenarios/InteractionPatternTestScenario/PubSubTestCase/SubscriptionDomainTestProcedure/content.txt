!4 Test procedure: subscription domain
This test checks that the domain specified by a Register is correctly interpreted by the broker.

A provider is publishing a set of updates with the following domains (the dot notation is used to separate the sub-domains):
 *	spacecraftA 
 *	spacecraftA.aocs 
 *	spacecraftA.aocs.thrustA 
 *	spacecraftA.payload
 *	spacecraftA.payload.cameraA.tempB
 *	spacecraftB
 *	agency.spacecraftA

Therefore a subscription message with the domain of spacecraftA and a NULL subDomain field would only match the first update.
A subscription message with the domain of spacecraftA and a subDomain field set to aocs would only match the second update.
A subscription message with the domain of spacecraftA and a subDomain field set to aocs.* would match the second and third updates.
A subscription message with the domain of spacecraftA and a subDomain field set to * would match updates 1 to 5.
