!4 Test procedure: subscription id
This test verifies that the URI of the consumer and the subscription identifier form the unique identifier of the subscription.

Two IPTest consumers are created. Two subscriptions with the same identifier 'sub1' are created with both consumers as defined below:
 * subscription identifier:	'sub1'
 * authentication identifier:	'0x00,0x01'
 * qos:	Assured
 * priority:	1
 * domain: 'Test,Domain1'
 * networkZone:	'!-NetworkZone-!'
 * session:	Live
 * session name: 'LIVE'
 * entity expression: 'A,null,null,null'
 * only on change: false
 
The consumer triggers one publication with the key 'A' and the update type 'Modification'.
The consumer checks that the update is received once by both consumers.
