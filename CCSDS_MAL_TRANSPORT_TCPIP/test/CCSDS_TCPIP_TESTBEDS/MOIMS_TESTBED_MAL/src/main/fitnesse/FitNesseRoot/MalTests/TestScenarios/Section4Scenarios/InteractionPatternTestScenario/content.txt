!2 IP test scenario
Two test cases are defined:
 * The first one tests every interaction pattern except the Pub/Sub pattern.
 * The second one is dedicated to the Pub/Sub pattern which is different as it does not involve the provider in the same way and it is more complex. Several aspects of the Pub/Sub pattern need to be tested. One test procedure is done for each of them.
Pub/Sub tests are to be done with a private and a shared broker.

Two constraints are required in order to check the IP state charts:
 * no message loss
 * FIFO message ordering is required

''As a consequence, the Best Effort !-QoS-! can only be used if the specific transport layer ensures in the context of the test bed that messages are delivered exactly once and according to a FIFO ordering.''
