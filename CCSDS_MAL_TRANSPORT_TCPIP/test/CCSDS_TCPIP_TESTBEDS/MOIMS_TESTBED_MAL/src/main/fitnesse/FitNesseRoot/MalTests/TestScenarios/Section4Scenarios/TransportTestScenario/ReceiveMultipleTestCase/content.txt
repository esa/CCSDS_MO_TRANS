!4 Test procedure: receive multiple interaction
As it is not possible to make the assumption that a transport module uses this interaction, the test transport module has to be enhanced with an operation enabling to trigger a RECEIVEMULTIPLE Indication.
An IPTest consumer is created. It is registered to the IPTest Pub/Sub operation. One update is published by calling the operation 'publishUpdate'. The Notify message is received by the consumer.
Then the test procedure copies this message twice, making two Notify messages and directly injects them into the test transport module in order to trigger a RECEIVEMULTIPLE Indication.
The test checks that two Notify messages are received by the consumer.
