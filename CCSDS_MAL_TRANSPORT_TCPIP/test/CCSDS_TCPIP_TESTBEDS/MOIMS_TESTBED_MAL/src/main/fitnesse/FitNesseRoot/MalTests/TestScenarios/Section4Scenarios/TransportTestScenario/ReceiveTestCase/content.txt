!4 Test procedure: receive interaction
An IPTest consumer is created and a Request interaction is initiated by calling the operation 'request'.
The test checks that the primitive 'TRANSMIT Request' has been called once by the MAL with a message which interaction stage is '2' (Request response coming from the actual transport).
