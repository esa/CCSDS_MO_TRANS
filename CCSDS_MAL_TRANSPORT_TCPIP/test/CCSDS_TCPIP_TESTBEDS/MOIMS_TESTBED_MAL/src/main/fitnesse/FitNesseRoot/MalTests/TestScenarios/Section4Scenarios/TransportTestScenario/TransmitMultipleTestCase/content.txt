!4 Test procedure: transmit multiple interaction
Two IPTest consumers are created and registered to the Pub/Sub operation provided by IPTest.
Then the test triggers a Publish to be done by the provider and checks that a Transmit Multiple has been done of the provider side with two Notify messages.

It should be noted that this is an optional requirement that Transmit Multiple is used, therefore a valid implementation may fail these tests. Because of this
the test result is just reported not failed on.
