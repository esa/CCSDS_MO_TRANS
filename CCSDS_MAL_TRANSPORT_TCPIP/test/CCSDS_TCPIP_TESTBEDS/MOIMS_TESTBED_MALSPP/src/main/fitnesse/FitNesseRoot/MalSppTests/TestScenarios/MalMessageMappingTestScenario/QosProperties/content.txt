!3 QoS properties test case

This test uses the Request interaction pattern in order to test that the !-QoS-! properties set at the provider side are effective in the Response MAL message.
One test procedure has been defined for every flag:
- authenticationIdFlagTest
- domainFlagTest
- networkZoneFlagTest
- priorityFlagTest
- sessionNameFlagTest
- timestampFlagTest
The provider has to set to false the value of the !-QoS-! property specified by the procedure.

Two cases are tested depending on the provider packet type (TC or TM).
- If the provider sends TC packets, then the missing field is assigned according to the consumer APID and APID qualifier.
- If the provider sends TM packets, then the missing field is assigned according to the provider APID and APID qualifier.

In the first case, the default MAL/SPP values are assigned because the consumer (APID 247/1) does not specify the mapping configuration parameters.
In the second case, the mapping configuration parameters of the provider (APID 348/4) are assigned.
